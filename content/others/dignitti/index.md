## Overview

Robotics has seen significant growth across the world in the last decade. Many advances have been made to both improve and expand robotics technologies. However, these advances have been largely spearheaded by Western and Asian research institutions and companies. Very little has been contributed to robotics development from African soil. As a result, very few robots exist that have been designed with the African context in mind. At the same time, many other robots are not useful in Africa. Many pressing problems in Africa that could easily be solved with robots have been left unattended because of the lack of robotics companies.

## Objectives

1. Develop robotics solutions for everyday problems through research and development.
2. Promote robotics education in Africa through targeted educational programs.
3. Provide an avenue for young African talents to hone skills and build experience in robotics.

## Works

- Currently, we focus on providing robotics training to basic school students in Ghana.
- We have trained over 50 students to build and program different kinds of small robots.
- Through our training program, students have developed line-following robots, obstacle avoidance robots, pick-n-place robots, etc.
