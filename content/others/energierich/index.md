## Our Mission

We seek to spark a transformation of the organization of economic production and innovation in underserved communities while inspiring global social consciousness for STEM innovators. Our work introduces locally assembled solar products at a lower cost than imported manufactured goods. The production of economically viable and socio-cultural appropriate technology produced by local populations, provides economic, educational, technological and health stimulus.

## Primary Goals

- Introduce local assembly of quality solar appropriate technology products to expand durable clean energy access.
- Inspire young underrepresented engineers, to become socially and environmentally conscious engineers.
- Teach local K-12 youth coding, Arduino, robotics and clean energy innovation with our ‚ÄúInnovation Workshops‚Äù held at Savannah Centre for Contemporary Art (SCCA).
- Bridge art and engineering to inspire local innovation by constructing solar panels at Red Clay Art Studio.

## My Work

I lead the engineering team and manage social media engagement at √ânergieRich. My role involves coordinating the engineering team and providing technical support for the development of our solar panels and other systems. Additionally, I ensure that the necessary tools, materials, and equipment for product development are available, offering logistical support to facilitate our projects.

Additionally, I support the development of a STEM education training program for K-12 students in underserved schools in Tamale, Ghana. I lead sessions and train these students to become proficient in basic electronics, coding, Arduino, robotics, and more.

I lead the development of our solar panel and environmental monitoring system. This system allows us and our users to monitor the performance of our solar systems and weather conditions remotely and in real time.
