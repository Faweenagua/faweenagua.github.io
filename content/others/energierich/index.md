## Our Mission

We seek to spark a transformation of the organization of economic production and innovation in underserved communities while inspiring global social consciousness for STEM innovators. Our work introduces locally assembled solar products at a lower cost than imported manufactured goods. The production of economically viable and socio-cultural appropriate technology produced by local populations, provides economic, educational, technological and health stimulus.

## Primary Goals

- Introduce local assembly of quality solar appropriate technology products to expand durable clean energy access.
- Inspire young underrepresented engineers, to become socially and environmentally conscious engineers.
- Teach local K-12 youth coding, Arduino, robotics and clean energy innovation with our ‚ÄúInnovation Workshops‚Äù held at Savannah Centre for Contemporary Art (SCCA).
- Bridge art and engineering to inspire local innovation by constructing solar panels at Red Clay Art Studio.

## My Work

I lead engineering and social media content at √ânergieRich. I coordinate the engineering team and provide technical support for the development of our solar panels and other systems. I also provide logistical support ensuring that the tools, materials and equipment required for product development are available.

In addition, I support the development of our STEM education training program for K-12 students in some underserved schools in Tamale, Ghana. I lead sessions and train these students to become profitient in basic electronics, coding, Arduino, robotics, etc.

I also lead the development of our solar panel and environmental monitoring system. This system enables us and our users to remotely and in real-time know the performance of our solar systems and weather conditions.
