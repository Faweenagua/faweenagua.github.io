      text: |-
        I love to research and develop new systems that push the boundaries of Science and Technology especially in Robotics. **I am interested in combining novel hardware designs with unique software algorithms to advance robot-robot and human-robot collaborations.** I envision a future where two or more ‘stranger’ robots or human and robot can meet and perform tasks together without any limitations.

        My areas of interest include Multi-robot systems, Human-robot collaboration, Robot Autonomy, Learning and the confluence of IoT and Robotics.

        Please reach out to collaborate 😃
